# Review Process

All applications submitted to the Interchain Foundation 
Funding Program go through a multi-stakeholder evaluation 
process to ensure our support aligns with the Interchain 
Foundation's mission. This document summarizes the
sequence in which proposals are processed. Review may be 
discontinued or applicants asked to revise their 
proposal at any point until a contract has been finalized.

## Granting Entities

Upon submission, the *Granting Entities*, 
[Interchain GmbH.](https://interchain.berlin/) and 
[Informal](https://informal.systems/), will assess whether an
application is complete and meets the legal criteria 
for consideration.

Granting Entities will then perform an initial review using the
following [evaluation criteria](./evaluation_criteria.md),
and solicit additional peer review where appropriate.

Each proposal will then be matched with a *Steward*, who will serve
as the Applicant's primary point of contact.

Once assigned, Stewards will setup an initial call with the Applicant
to clarify outstanding questions about their submission and revise
the proposed scope, timeline, and budget as needed. Together they 
will draft a prospective *Financing Agreement*, which will used as 
the basis for subsequent evaluation.

## Board of Management & Technical Advisory Committee

The draft Financing Agreement, together with Granting Entity reviews
and the original application are delivered to the *Board of
Management*, a supervisory body employed by the Interchain Foundation.

The Board of Management will administer the assembly of a *Technical
Advisory Committee*, composed of domain experts with a record
of community contribution. This committee will provide feedback
on each proposal's technical soundness and benefit to the wider
ecosystem.

The Board of Management will then incorporate feedback from the 
Technical Advisory Committee with all previous materials, to create
a final package which is either unanimously endorsed or returned 
to Stewards with revising comments.

## Foundation Council

Endorsed packages are then sent to the *Foundation Council*,
who will certify their final approval by signing the 
Financing Agreement, or exercising a final veto. Given the 
extent of prior due diligence, the Foundation Council must 
provide a strong justification to deny final approval.

## Common Reasons a Proposal is _Not_ Funded

- Incomplete Scope, Budget, or Timeline
- Asking amount is too high
- Timing (too early for Interchain Foundation consideration)
- Previously supported similar work
- Not relevant to Interchain Foundation mandate
