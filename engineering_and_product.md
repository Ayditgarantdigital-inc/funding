# Engineering

We are primarily interested in general purpose technologies that expand the
capabilities of the Cosmos ecosystem and its intersection with other languages and networks.

The topics listed here are not exhaustive, but provide an idea of what we're interested in.


- Hardware
    - HSMs
    - Open source chips

- Cryptography - Secure and performant library implementations
    - Elliptic curves (secp256k1, ed25519, etc.)
    - Pairing curves
    - Signature schemes (ECDSA, Ristretto, etc.)
    - Zero Knowledge Proofs (Bulletproofs, SNARKs, STARKs, etc)
    - Quantum safe systems
    - Security audits

- Serialization
    - Amino in other languages - [https://github.com/tendermint/go-amino](https://github.com/tendermint/go-amino)

- Databases
    - Merkle data stores
    - IAVL in other languages - [https://github.com/tendermint/iavl](https://github.com/tendermint/iavl)

- Tendermint
    - See open issues at: [https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issue](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues)
     - Integration with libp2p
     - Integration with external indexers (eg. Postgres)
     - Clients in other languages (data structures, RPC, lite-client, full node)

- ABCI Frameworks
    - Improvements to existing frameworks like [Cosmos-SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) and [LotionJS](https://github.com/keppel/lotion)
    - ABCI Frameworks in other languages 

- IBC
    - Protocol formalization
    - Implementation in other languages

- Pegs to other networks
    - Ethereum, Bitcoin, ZCash, Tezos, etc.

- Applications and Modules
    - Ethereum on Tendermint (ie. Ethermint)
    - Bitcoin/ZCash/Monero/Tezos on Tendermint
    - Clone of etcd/consul/zookeeper
    - Virtual machines
    - State channels
    - Games

- Tooling
    - Deployment
    - Monitoring
    - Benchmarking

# Product

- Network explorers
- Wallets for hubs and zones
- Governance and staking interfaces
- Products serving particular network-participants (eg. validators, delegators, or others).
