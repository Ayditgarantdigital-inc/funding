# Interchain Foundation Funding Program
  
The Interchain Foundation (ICF) has a broad mandate to support 
the development of open-source decentralized networks. This 
repository contains information about proposal topics that may 
be eligible for support, along with instructions for applicants,
and a registry of past funding recipients.

## How to Apply


~ Application Instructions here ~


The Interchain Foundation uses the following categories to 
track quarterly contributions to the fulfillment of our mandate.
Each category contains a non-inclusive list of topics, which 
could provide the basis for a sucessful funding proposal.

- [Social Good & Community](./social_good_and_community.md)
- [Research](./research.md)
- [Engineering & Product](./engineering_and_product.md)

## Review Process

All applications undergo a [review process](./review_process.md) 
throughout which additional information may be requested.

We often work with applicants to revise their proposed scope to 
ensure success and better meet the needs of the ecosystem.

## Funded Projects

See a list of projects funded to date [here](projects/)

## Contribution

Open source projects funded by the ICF are required to adhere to 
these [contribution guidelines](./contribution_guidelines.md).
